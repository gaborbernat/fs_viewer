      HTTP Sessions are disabled by default. To enable HTTP sessions specify:

        <sessions-enabled>true</sessions-enabled>

      It's possible to reduce request latency by configuring your application to
      asynchronously write HTTP session data to the datastore:

        <async-session-persistence enabled="true" />

      With this feature enabled, there is a very small chance your app will see
      stale session data. For details, see
      http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/config/appconfig.html#Enabling_Sessions
